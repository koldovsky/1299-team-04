        "We will tell you how to choose pink furniture in your interior. Design specialists, designers, architects, editors of specialized magazines identified coloristic dominants that express the mood of the time. So, here are the trending furniture colors for 2020:",
        "The source of inspiration was the gentle, subtle colors of the morning sky at different times of the year. The psychological message of the chosen tone is connected with the paradoxical emotional disunity of people in the era of high technology: the better digital connections, the weaker the human connection. This topic does not arise for the first year - among designers, philosophers, filmmakers.

Trendy green shades in the interior of 2020 look modern and dramatic, especially in conjunction with metal."
