    <h1 class="inner-post__title">Trending 2020 Colors for Interior</h1>
    <p class="inner-post__author">Susan Drill</p>
    <p class="inner-post__paragraph">
      Reputable manufacturers of interior paints, collection wallpapers and selected top design
      studios annually announce the shade that, in their opinion, should dominate next season. This
      time, the focus was on three palettes - of varying degrees of saturation and warmth, but
      united by the idea of the proximity of man and nature, a return to mental and physical
      harmony. Design specialists, designers, architects, editors of specialized magazines
      identified coloristic dominants that express the mood of the time. So, here are the trending
      furniture colors for 2020:

    <h2 class="inner-post__under-title">Tranquil Dawn</h2>
    <p class="inner-post__paragraph">
      The source of inspiration was the gentle, subtle colors of the morning sky at different times
      of the year. The psychological message of the chosen tone is connected with the paradoxical
      emotional disunity of people in the era of high technology: the better digital connections,
      the weaker the human connection. This topic does not arise for the first year - among
      designers, philosophers, filmmakers. The serene pale green shades used in the home space are
      designed to calm, create a harmonious peaceful background, cause a desire to touch each other.
      In the interior, the color is recommended to be used as an alternative to white - for walls,
      ceilings, wooden surfaces. Experts compiled four supporting palettes for the main tone, each
      of which corresponds to the shades of dawn according to the seasons and is represented by a
      colder or warmer range.

    <h2 class="inner-post__under-title">Bleached Coral</h2>
    <p class="inner-post__paragraph">
      The bleached blue shade is universal - it is neutral, like gray, and at the same time, it's
      bright and creative, like white. Light and airy tones look optimistic, relax and soothe. Cool
      in tone, it goes well with warm beige, pink, green, yellow, white colors, dark wood. Blue-gray
      can be used in modern, traditional and vintage styles for painting walls, upholstery,
      curtains.

    <h2 class="inner-post__under-title">Adeline</h2>
    <p class="inner-post__paragraph">
      The British company Graham & Brown, which sets the world fashion for wallpaper and premium
      class finishes, has voiced its own favorite - a shade of Adeline (in honor of the full name of
      the famous writer Virginia Woolf). This is the name of a deep, dark green color with excellent
      aesthetic characteristics: it creates a natural, calm atmosphere in the apartment, and due to
      its versatility, it is suitable for decoration of any room. Trendy green shades in the
      interior of 2020 look modern and dramatic, especially in conjunction with metal.
